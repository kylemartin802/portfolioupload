        <h2>My Personal Projects</h2>
        Over the last few years I have developed a portfolio of projects undertaken outside of academic or work settings, using a variety of different technologies.
        Here you can find examples of a few of these projects.
        <br><br>
        <h2>The Storyteller Bot [2018]</h2>
        I am a fan of the social deduction game <a href="https://bloodontheclocktower.com/">Blood on the Clocktower</a> (BotC).
        <br>I was first introduced to the game at University, and I saw an opportunity to create an easier way to host the games online rather than just in person.
        <br> A group of us have been playing online BotC regularly since the start of the year, but as the game requires groups of at least 6 to play (5 players plus 1 'storyteller' to run the sessions), occasionally we have to cancel games due to a lack of players. This is where the Storyteller bot comes in.
        <br><br>The Storyteller Discord Bot autonomously organises and runs BotC sessions, allowing an extra player to participate. It handles all the game logic, contacts players privately to record their night actions and uses a MySQL database to store game and player data.
        <br><br> Here are a few screenshots of the bot in action:

        <h2>Unity 2D Games [2018]</h2>
        Over the summer of 2020 I set about learning how to use the Unity game engine to create 2D games in C#. I worked through a number of tutorials getting to grips with the game engine and learning C# before moving on to bigger projects.
        <br /> I ended up producing a clone of my favourite card game, 'Hearts', with opponent AI that plays to win. You can play the game <a href="/hearts.html">here</a>.
        <br> I also took part in a 24 hour game jam to help develop my skills, where participants were given a set of art assets and challenged to make a game using them. I produced a spin-off of the popular arcade game tetris in which players stack blocks to match images.

        <br><br>
